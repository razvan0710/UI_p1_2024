component - (data, js logic, jsx) 
data is parsing to componets as a props

1. state - state is a data that is changing in the component

UI - split into componets tree
Static version of react (without states)

2. Local state - state that is changing in the component vs 
    Global state - state that is changing in the app

3. Derived state- state that is calculated from other state (don't use useState when is not necessary)
